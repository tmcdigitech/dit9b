Iago was a very early Othello/Reversi game, which offered excellent gameplay. You could play against a friend or a computer with three levels of difficulty, on three different sizes of board.
It even has a special feature to hide the game if you are playing it at work and your boss is coming&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Phrase Craze</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/inspiration/PhraseCraze/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/inspiration/PhraseCraze/</guid><description>by Brad Pettit (1986)
Borrowing heavily from the TV game show Wheel of Fortune, Phrase Craze offers up to four players the chance to relive the thrill of being on the set, complete with game board, wheel, and charming host. You could also modify the PhraseFile to create your own puzzles.</description></item><item><title>StuntCopter</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/inspiration/StuntCopter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/inspiration/StuntCopter/</guid><description>by Duane Blehm (1986)
Part of the genius of this game is how simple it is. Your aim is to drop people out of a helicopter onto the cart, carefully avoiding the rider and the horse. The further up you drop from, the more points you get. See what happens when you drop someone through the clouds&amp;hellip;
If you go to Options &amp;gt; OffScreen in the menu, you can also see the complete sprite sheet for the game; a nice touch.</description></item></channel></rss>
