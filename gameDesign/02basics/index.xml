These programs can be entered using any text editor, but I suggest using the Mu editor because it comes with Python, Pygame Zero and other libraries all pre-installed in one easy download.
3.1. Hello, world The traditional first program used to make sure Python is working and that we can run programs.
If using the Mu editor:
Click the mode button and make sure the mode is set to Python3.</description></item><item><title>Drawing graphics</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/graphics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/graphics/</guid><description>adapted from Coding Games with Pygame Zero &amp;amp; Python, by Richard Smith
To create graphics for our games we will use the Pygame Zero library. You will find the documentation on the website useful!
The smallest square that can be displayed on a monitor is called a pixel. This diagram shows a close-up view of a window that is 40 pixels wide and 40 pixels high. At normal size you will not see the grid lines.</description></item><item><title>Drawing graphics (slides)</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/graphicsSlides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/graphicsSlides/</guid><description>Drawing graphics adapted from Coding Games with Pygame Zero &amp;amp; Python, by Richard Smith
The smallest square that can be displayed on a monitor is called a pixel. This diagram shows a close-up view of a window that is 40 pixels wide and 40 pixels high. At normal size you will not see the grid lines.
We can refer to any pixel by giving two co-ordinates,
(x, y)
Make sure you understand co-ordinates before moving on because everything we do in Pygame Zero will use it.</description></item><item><title>Arcade games</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/arcade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9a/gameDesign/02basics/arcade/</guid><description>adapted from Coding Games with Pygame Zero &amp;amp; Python, by Richard Smith
