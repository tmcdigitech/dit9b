You might want to limit the controls so the player cannot move backwards, meaning they have to turn the ship around to move forwards. We won&amp;rsquo;t worry about that here.
We set up a script and attach it to the player ship.</description></item><item><title>Wrapping the screen</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9b/deepSpace/screenWrapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit9b/deepSpace/screenWrapping/</guid><description>In some games, when the player or certain objects move off one edge of the screen, they re-emerge on the opposite edge. This can be achieved using the following block of code, placed inside the Update() method of an object&amp;rsquo;s script.
The margin property can be tuned according to preference. The object must go past the edge of the margin, not just the screen, to be teleported to the other edge.</description></item></channel></rss>
