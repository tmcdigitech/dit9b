[{"id":0,"href":"/dit9b/relief/","title":"RELIEF LESSON","parent":"9 Digital Tech","content":"Monday T2.9 (4 July)\nThis morning you should work through the challenges 1-7 in Task 1, which are on Sequence.\nSome of you did these last semester, but in Python. This time you\u0026rsquo;ll need to do them in C#, and you will find it instructive to compare the code from the two languages.\nYou should write these programs using .NET Fiddle. As you finish each one and have tested it successfully, copy the completed code into a new file in Visual Studio Code and save it into a folder named task1 in your Digital Tech folder. Give each one a name according to the number of the exercise: number 1 will be ex1.cs, number 2 will be ex2.cs, and so on.\nTo help you with the structure and specifics of C#, here is the complete code for exercise 2:\nusing System; public class Program { public static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;What is your first name?\u0026#34;); string firstname = Console.ReadLine(); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;What is your surname?\u0026#34;); string surname = Console.ReadLine(); Console.WriteLine(surname+\u0026#34; \u0026#34;+firstname); } } A couple of useful notes:\n.NET Fiddle provides you with the necessary code to get started. You should leave the surrounding code in place, and only change the bits inside the Main() function, which initially is the line with \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; in it. notice that statements must end with a semicolon (;), as in the example .NET Fiddle begins with you need to declare variables before you use them the first time (as in the example above, where we put \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; before the name of the variables firstname and surname in their first use). If you write to them a second time, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to declare their type again. If you need to convert a string into an integer, which has the type int, you can use the function int.Parse(\u0026quot;32\u0026quot;), where you replace the string \u0026quot;32\u0026quot; with the variable you want to interpret as a number. For example, this code will read in a number from the console and print out double that number: using System; public class Program { public static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;What is your favourite whole number?\u0026#34;); int number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); number = number*2; Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Double that number is \u0026#34;+number+\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;); } } "},{"id":1,"href":"/dit9b/assessment/","title":"Assessment Tasks","parent":"9 Digital Tech","content":""},{"id":2,"href":"/dit9b/assessment/progCheckpoint/sequence/","title":"Sequence","parent":"1: Programming Checkpoints","content":"from The Computing Zone\n1. Three in, three out Write a program that will allow a user to enter their name (string), their age (integer) and their favourite TV program (string). The program will then display the information entered and some additional text on separate lines. An example of the input and output from the program is shown below. What is your name? \u0026gt; Lister What is your age? \u0026gt; 39 What is your favourite TV program? \u0026gt; Red Dwarf Lister is 39 years old and likes Red Dwarf 2.

Area of a rectangle Ask your user to enter the length and width of a rectangle. Your program should calculate the area of the rectangle (length*width) and display the result with a suitable message. Please enter the following values in cm. Please enter the length of the rectangle. \u0026gt; 12 Please enter the width of the rectangle. \u0026gt; 6 The area of the rectangle is: 72 square centimetres 5. Area of a circle Ask your user to enter the radius of a circle. Your program should use what they have entered to calculate the area of the circle (pi*radius*radius) and display the result. Please enter the following values in cm. Please enter the radius of the circle. \u0026gt; 16 The area of the circle is: 803.84 square centimetres 6. Number cruncher Write a program that inputs two individual integers between 0 and 9. The program should then combine the inputs to form a single number in a third variable. The program should show the equation of multiplying the three numbers together and the result, as shown in the example. Enter the first number (0-9). \u0026gt; 2 Enter the second number (0-9). \u0026gt; 3 2 x 3 x 23 = 138 7. Address formatter A program is required to format and store a users address in a single string. The user should be asked these questions:\nWhat is your house number? What is the name of your street? What suburb/town do you live in? What is your postcode?\nThe program will then combine the user\u0026rsquo;s answers in a single string, formatted as shown in the example. The program will display the string on the screen.\nWhat is your house number? \u0026gt; 13 What is the name of your street? \u0026gt; Aberlove Drive What suburb/town do you live in? \u0026gt; Buckhaven What is your postcode? \u0026gt; 4039 13 Aberlove Drive BUCKHAVEN 4039 8.

Darts During a game of darts, the highest score that can be achieved in a single turn is 180. The lowest is 0. Write a program that will allow a dart player to enter their score. The program should congratulate the player if their score was over 100. If the player scores less than 10 they should be told that some practice is required. Please enter your score: \u0026gt; 125 What a great score! Well done. Please enter your score: \u0026gt; 7 That was rubbish. Get practising! 11. Charity Collection Three friends have been collecting money for charity. A local company has offered to double the amount of money they collect if they raise over $1000. Write a program that allows the friends to enter their individual amounts. The program should then add the three amounts and store the total. If the total is greater or equal to $1000 the total should be doubled. Finally the total should be displayed. Enter the first amount raised. \u0026gt; 398 Enter the second amount raised. \u0026gt; 193 Enter the third amount raised. \u0026gt; 478 A total of $1069 was raised. This will be doubled to $2138. 12.

Cricket over In cricket a bowler bowls 6 balls at a time. This is called an over. Each ball bowled may be hit by the batter who may score some runs. Write a program that allows the runs from an over to be entered (for example: 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 6). The total scored in that over should then be displayed. Please enter the runs for each ball: \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 2 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026gt; 4 \u0026gt; 6 This over\u0026#39;s score was 12. 15. Flexible cheater The naughty pupil forgot to hand their lines in and now has more to do. Adapt program 13 to allow the pupil to select how many lines the program produces.

Adapt program 11 to repeatedly ask for the next amount of money raised. If the user types a number, that number is added to the total and the program asks again. If the user just presses Enter, with nothing else, the program stops asking and displays the total raised, including the doubled value if appropriate. Enter the total raised by each person: \u0026gt; 238 \u0026gt; 624 \u0026gt; 546 \u0026gt; 333 \u0026gt; 651 \u0026gt; 174 \u0026gt; A total of $2566 was raised. This will be increased to $4566. 17. Password The program should give the user an error message if they enter the wrong password. A message “Entry gained!” should be displayed when the password is entered correctly. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; snool Sorry, Incorrect! Try again. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; giraffe Sorry, Incorrect! Try again. Please enter the password. \u0026gt; sesame Entry gained! 18. No more presents You have money to spend on your birthday. Write a program that will ask you what you have to spend, and then to enter the price of each present you want until your total reaches or is over the amount you started with. The program should produce the output shown. How much money did you get? \u0026gt; 200 You have $200. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 35 You have $165. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 100 You have $65. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 50 You have $15. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 45 You have overspent! You can\u0026#39;t afford the $45 item. How much money did you get? \u0026gt; 48 You have $48. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 48 You have spent all $48! 19. Guess the number A game is created where a user is required to guess an unknown number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Each time the user guesses the program informs them if their guess is too high, too low or correct. The guessing game only finishes when the user’s guess matches the unknown number. I\u0026#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Which number do you think it is? 45 Your guess is too low. Try again. 86 Your guess is too high. Try again. 67 Your guess is too high. Try again. 50 Your guess is too low. Try again. 54 Your guess is too high. Try again. 52 Correct! I was thinking of 52. 20. Dance group (extension) You have been asked to write a program to store the names and ages of competitors in a dance competition. The program should display the name of the competitor and which level of competition they should be entered in. ‘Junior’ competitors are less than 12 years old, ‘Senior’ competitors are at least 18 years old. ‘Intermediate’ competitors are aged 12-17.

In C#, console functions are part of the Console class, and the equivalent to Python\u0026rsquo;s print function is Console.WriteLine(). If you don\u0026rsquo;t want it to automatically add a line break, you can use the Console.Write() function.\nInput Python response = input(\u0026#34;What is your name? \u0026#34;) C# Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;What is your name? \u0026#34;) response = Console.ReadLine(); Python\u0026rsquo;s input() function takes a parameter which is printed, like a question, before reading in the response from the user.

These different kinds of information are known as types, and they exist in all programming languages.\nThe Python interpreter allows the programmer to ignore many of the issues of typing much of the time, as it can infer a lot from the code. But you would have had to convert numbers into text using the str() function, and this is an example of type conversion.\nC# requires you to be a lot more explicit about the types of variables and their conversion, so you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more exposure to the idea of types.\nCommon types int Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative. They are a fixed number of digits long, so there is a maximum and minimum value you can store in one.\nfloat/double Floating point is the most common way to store decimals; it stores them in scientific notation. There are a certain number of digits for the exponent, and a certain number for the mantissa. The fixed number of digits means there are values that can\u0026rsquo;t be stored, so the computer will round to the nearest valid value. Floats are usually 32-bits (32 binary digits long), and doubles are, as their name might suggest, 64-bits long. This gives doubles much more room for extra digits, meaning far less likelihood of drifting and errors due to rounding.\nchar/strings Any time input is read in from the keyboard, or text output to the screen, strings of characters are involved. A single entity, like \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;%\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;3\u0026rsquo; are characters, and are indicated with single quotes. Multiple characters together are known as strings, and are represented with double quotes.\nNote that Python doesn\u0026rsquo;t really distinguish between characters and strings, and uses single and double quotes interchangeably. This is not the case in C#.\nbool Booleans are true/false values. The conditions in if and while loops must have boolean values; that is, they evaluate either to true or false.\nIn Python, the keywords are True/False, with a capital letter. In C#, they are true/false, without one.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/dit9b/pyToCs/","title":"From Python to C-sharp","parent":"9 Digital Tech","content":""},{"id":8,"href":"/dit9b/pyToCs/if/","title":"if statements","parent":"From Python to C-sharp","content":" Basic if Python if condition: statements regularFlow C# if( condition ){ statements; } regularFlow; if/else Python if condition: statements else: statements regularFlow C# if( condition ){ statements; }else{ statements; } regularFlow; chained if Python if condition: statements elif otherCondition: statements else: statements regularFlow C# if( condition ){ statements; }else if( otherCondition ){ statements; }else{ statements; } regularFlow; "},{"id":9,"href":"/dit9b/pyToCs/while/","title":"while loops","parent":"From Python to C-sharp","content":" Python while condition: statements regularFlow C# while( condition ){ statements; } regularFlow; "},{"id":10,"href":"/dit9b/pyToCs/for/","title":"for loops","parent":"From Python to C-sharp","content":" Python In Python, the range() function is commonly used to make a loop that counts through some number:\nrange(4) will give the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 (i.e. 0 to not-quite 4); range(1,4) will give the numbers 1, 2, 3 (i.e. 1 to not-quite 4); range(1,4,2) will give the numbers 1, 3 (i.e. 1 to not-quite 4, increasing by 2).
